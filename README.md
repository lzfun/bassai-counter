# bassai-counter

This is a counter to record how many times I've practiced the [bassai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXPZFarJMh0) kata as part of my [Shotokan Karate](https://ska.org/) practice. The goal is to reach 5000 before I can be promoted to black belt. 

By building the counter, I also learnt 
- [how to host Telegram Bot on Vercel](https://www.marclittlemore.com/serverless-telegram-chatbot-vercel/)
- basic JavaScript syntax, to parse Telegram Bot messages
- read and write to GitHub file using [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/core.js/)
